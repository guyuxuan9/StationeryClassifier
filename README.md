The full code is given in the **CameraApp.py** file. This is a very basic version of a camera app that has the following functions:
- If **Take Picture** button is pressed, an image will be saved to the given directory
- It offers two modes: **Manual** and **Automatic**. In Manual mode, the user needs to press the **Take Picture** button manually to capture an image. In Automatic mode, the user can set the interval between image captures by entering the desired interval in seconds into the input box and pressing the **Set Interval(s)** button.
- The console message will be displayed as well.
- The image name represents the date and time of the image taken.
